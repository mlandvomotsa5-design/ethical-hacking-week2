# Module 2: Footprinting & Reconnaissance with GHDB

## Overview
This module focuses on passive reconnaissance using the Google Hacking Database (GHDB) hosted on Exploit-DB. By using specialized search operators (Google Dorks), sensitive information and publicly exposed assets are identified without directly interacting with target systems.
